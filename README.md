## Development Setup

After cloning or downloading the repo, type `npm run dev` in the terminal and
the server and client servers will start. Client server is on port 3000, server
side server is on port 5000. To just run server side server, from root directory
type `npm start`. To just run client server, from root directory type `cd client && npm start`

Note that before starting the server the following environment variables should
be defined:

| Variable Name       | Description                                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| MONGO_URI           | URL of your MongoDB database                         |
| GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID    | Client ID of your Google+ API credentials            |
| GOOGLE_SECRET_KEY   | Corresponding secret key to API credentials          |
| FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID  | App ID of registered Facebook app                    |
| FACEBOOK_SECRET_KEY | Corresponding secret key to app                      |
| GITHUB_CLIENT_ID    | Client ID of Github OAuth app                        |
| GITHUB_SECRET_KEY   | Corresponding secret key to OAuth app                |
| TWITTER_CLIENT_ID   | Client ID of Twitter app                             |
| TWITTER_SECRET_KEY  | Corresponding secret key to the app                  |
| COOKIE_KEY          | Secret cookie key for login session. Can be anything |

Create a file called `dev.js` in `server/config` directory. Assign an object
with the environment variables to module.exports. The fields of the object
should be in camel case i.e.

```
module.exports = {
	mongoURI: 'your-mongo-url',
	googleClientID: 'your-google-client-id',
	googleSecretKey: 'your-google-secret-key',
	facebookClientID: 'your-facebook-client-id',
	facebookSecretKey: 'your-facebook-secret-key',
	githubClientID: 'your-github-client-id',
	githubSecretKey: 'your-github-secret-key',
	twitterClientID: 'your-twitter-client-id',
	twitterSecretKey: 'your-twitter-secret-key'
	cookieKey: 'your-cookie-key'
}
```
